Hi! I'm Diogo and I work with coding about 10 years by now. I have experience with `PHP` and `Javascript` languages. As a developer, web development is my thing, working really professionally with `HTML` and `CSS` (I love to build web components).

I'm author of the book "Cordova & Phonegap Advanced", published in 2018 by Casa do CÃ³digo in Brazil. I have a strong experience with `Ionic`, `Cordova`, and publishing apps to iOS and Android platforms.

The Javascript framework I'm more experienced is `Angular`, since way back from `AngularJS`. But recently, I started to study `React Native` and, consequently, `React`, and I'm loving to work with both.

So, to wrap up everything, I'm a developer that like play with UX. So, don't be surprised if you see me prototyping some app using `Figma`, which I also have a well reviewed course about it at Udemy.
